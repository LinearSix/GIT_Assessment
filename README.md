Explain what a version control system is.<br />
     A VCS is a way to track revisions of your project/code and view/revert to earlier versions if desired.<br />
 <br />
Explain why a version control system is important.<br />
     A VCS is important because it allows the user to revert to earlier versions of files mistakes are made.<br />
 <br />
Explain what Git is.<br />
     A free, open-source VCS (delvoped by the maker of Linux)<br />
 <br />
Initialize a Git repository.<br />
     How about 2 instead?<br />
     * CLI_Assessment<br />
     * GIT_Assessment<br />
 <br />
Add and commit changes to a Git repository.<br />
     Added README.md to both repositories (using terminal)<br />
 <br />
Explain what GitHub is.<br />
    GitHub is a server which allows hosting of GIT repositories to help facilitate collaboration.<br />
    It also acts as a safe backup for repository information in case of local repository failure or <br />corruption.<br />
 <br />
Push commits from a local repository to a remote repository.<br />
     Pushed assignment content additions of README.md files to CLI_Assessment and GIT_Assessment.<br />
      <br />
GIT Assessment<br />
Know the following:<br />
<br />
Why do we use Git?<br />
    * For version control<br />
    * In case we need to view, access, or restore and earlier version of a file<br />
 <br />
What is the difference between Git and Github<br />
    * Git is a VCS.<br />
    * GitHub is server which hosts Git repositories for collaboration and backup.<br />
 <br />
How does Git work?<br />
    * Files are staged for addition (or not) into the next revision using git commands<br />
    * git add + filename stages the file(s) to be revised<br />
    * git commit -m 'comment' essentially seals and labels the package of files to be sent to the VCS<br />
    * git push completes the upload of committed files to the VCS<br />
 <br />
What is a Git repository?<br />
    * A folder that has been designated (initialized) as a Git VCS directory<br />
 <br />
Initialize a Git repository<br />
    * completed<br />
     <br />
add and commit changes to a Git repository<br />
    * Oh so many changes<br />
     <br />
Add remote destinations to your local Git repository<br />
    * Two of them<br />
     <br />
push commits from your local Git repository to a remote repository<br />
    * I pushed it good<br />
